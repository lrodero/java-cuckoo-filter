This is an implementation of Cuckoo Filters, as defined in "Cuckoo Filter: Better than Bloom" (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~binfan/papers/login_cuckoofilter.pdf) paper. A cuckoo filter is similar to bloom filters in functionality: is a data structure that can be used to test whether an element (item) is part of a set.
